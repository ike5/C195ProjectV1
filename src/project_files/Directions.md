### Signup to lucidchart.com and design a UML Class diagram with:
- Concrete classes that Map or Reflect the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) you've been provided with. 
- The UML Class Diagram should also have Utility / Helper Classes that use JDBC interfaces for:
  - Connecting to the Database
  - generating PreparedStatements and ResultSets. 
- Use Abstract classes with static methods for handling MySQL SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. 
- Define Functional Interfaces for your Lambda expressions. 
  - You may use Inheritance (where applicable), and use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern. 
  - The Concrete classes, when Instantiated, serve as Objects that map the database table rows for use with Collections such as the ObservableArrayList and ArrayLists.
